  title     = "Stealing freedom: Auto theft and autonomous individualism in
               American film",
  author    = "Uhlman, James Todd and Heitmann, John Alfred",
  abstract  = "In the real world today auto theft is usually about gangs,
               drugs, and money (Heitmann and Morales 5). However, since 1945,
               the cinematic representation of auto theft has had more to do
               with the symbolic meaning cars and driving hold in American
               culture. In the early twentieth century, the automobile and
               driving became associated with many of the classic qualities of
               American identity (March and Collette 107). The roots of that
               expectation stretch back even further to the role that movement
               played in the colonization of the continent. The unrestrained
               capacity to move became equated early in the American cultural
               imagination with personal reinvention and self-determination
               (Feldman 13--19). Those who could control their own movement
               were deemed self-sufficient, independent agents. Thus, the
               capacity of movement became linked to political economy. Indeed,
               mobility came to stand for liberty itself. But, as in early
               America, the capacity to move freely was frequently denied to
               those not white or male. The lack of mobility marked
               African-American slaves and women as unfit for individual
               liberty and incapable of sovereign selfhood. The American vision
               of the mobile, liberal individual was both raced and gendered
               (Cresswell 147--74).",
