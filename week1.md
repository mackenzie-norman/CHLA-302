Giving a diverse group of people a label is often a reductive act, rooted in the ethos of imperialism and by extension the capitalist state.  This can be interrogated by examining the term Latino/a/x. 

 

"[Latino] implies a pan-ethnic group. It implies, in other words, that a “Latino” identity exists that binds these various groups together in some tangible, substantive ways - ways that matter. It is much like using a term such as “Indian” instead of “Cherokee,” “Chickasaw,” or “Choctaw”; it suggests a grouping together of groups that, historically, have not always seen themselves as belonging to that larger group identity." 

 

In comparing the usage of Latino to Indian, Caminero-Santangelo gives a starting point to inspect the imperialist nature of creating these pan-ethnic groups. Grouping dissimilar peoples under an umbrella terms allows for these groups to be dehumanized - no longer is there the individual with a name, a home, a job. They are reduced to a Latino or an Indian. The inherent imperialism of this is not just that these terms are dehumanizing but that they inherently fail to describe any of the individuals, creating a deep sense of ‘other’, perpetuating the empire by giving people a way out - become american  - eschew your heritage and swear loyalty to the empire. Only then will you not be an ‘other’. 

 

 Capitalism wields this well, perpetuating these stereotypes and false dichotomies in order to profit. 

 

"Silvio Torres-Saillant (2002) argues that Spanish-language media, such as television networks Telemundo and Univisión, have vigorously promoted a sense of a coherent and unified “Latino” identity because it is profitable to do so." 

 

Extending from this quote, this becomes profitable because consumerism IS the cultural currency of the united states, as such, in order to assimilate you must be a consumer. By creating a label that does not truly fit anyone who it describes, making them feel othered, then providing and productizing what is claimed to be the panacea to make the consumer feel as if they are part of a group that they can never truly be a part of.
