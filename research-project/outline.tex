\section*{Topic} Questions of agency raised by Chicano Literature

\section*{Tentative thesis statement} 

How does chicano literature, in particular The Book of Unknown Americans approach the question of agency/freewill\cite{Henriquez2014-sh}?
\subsection*{Intro}
Introduce topic, and primary text (TBUA)
\subsection*{Guilt as a manifestation of agency in TBUA}
This will mostly drive from TBUA and the schmid paper. \cite{schmid_2016_depiction}
\subsection*{American ideas of Jeffersonian Individualism and Masculinty contrasting with Women.}
Also driving from TBUA and both resources , may split into two sections. Driven by \cite{zavala_2018_adolescent} \cite{schmid_2016_depiction}
\subsection*{Adolescence as a proving grounds for agency}
Certainly TBUA and Zavala\cite{zavala_2018_adolescent}

\subsection*{Vehicles in TBUA}
Will probably need a few sources for this
\subsection*{Closing}
